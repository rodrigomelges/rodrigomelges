### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Rodrigo Melges**. I work as a maintenance technician in SÃ£o Paulo subway - Brazil (ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·), but sometimes I like to program. Nowadays I'm studying some crazy things about **data science**. I graduated in **computer engineering** and currently I'm in a specialization in FIA about data analysis. I created this profile to share some projects... Or nor :). **I really love Python, but R are welcome.**

In my free time I like to play chess, play poker, watch series. You can find me...
